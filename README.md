# Air-Writing

This is a program created using data I collected and fed into Edge Impulse. 

The Model was then trained and then a Arduino file was created that can be loaded into the Arduino IDE. The model is running on the Arduino Nano BLE 33 Sense but can be deployed to other devices including your phone.

Once the code was loaded into the Arduino Ide, simple logic was added to handle the light which uses the Grove chainable LED light to change color mataching the output. The Grove chainable LED libary is included in the code.
